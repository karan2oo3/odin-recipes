     <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li><b>Meat</b>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><b>Onion</b>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><b>Garlic</b>>: Garlic adds a ton of flavor to the meat sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Tomatoes</b>: Canned crushed tomatoes are the base of the sauce. You can also use canned diced tomatoes or whole tomatoes that you crush yourself.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar</b>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>

        <li><b>Lasagna noodles</b>: You'll need 9 lasagna noodles for this recipe. You can use no-boil noodles or traditional noodles that you boil before layering.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese</b>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><b>Egg</b>: An egg is mixed into the cheese layer to help bind everything together.</li>
     </ul>

     <h4>STEPS</h4>
     <ol>
        <li><b>Cook the meat</b>: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the noodles</b>: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
        <li><b>Make the cheese layer</b>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble the lasagna</b>: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the lasagna</b>: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
